# Road Trip Fuel Cost Calculation
Calculates total user cost of fuel based on two inputs: the distance of the trip in kilometers and the price of the fuel. Assume that the average fuel consumption rate is 6.9 L/100km.

## Requirements:
Calculate the total cost of fuel using this formula:<br>
total cost of fuel = trip distance * fuel price * average fuel consumption rate
<br><br>
Sample run: (inputs are underlined)<br>
Enter distance of trip (km): 590<br>
Enter fuel price ($/L): 1.57<br>
Total trip fuel cost: $63.91470000000001
